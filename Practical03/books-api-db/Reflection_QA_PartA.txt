Reflection:
Working on this lab, I found that placing all the database logic directly in route
handlers makes the code difficult to read and understand. Each route handler contains
not just the API logic but also database connection management, SQL queries, and error handling,
making them very long and complex.

If I found a bug in how books are created, it would be challenging to isolate and fix
because the database logic is embedded in the route handlers. I'd need to be careful
that my fix doesn't break other functionality within the same handler.

During implementation, I found managing database connections for each route to be repetitive and
error-prone. I had to make sure each route properly closes connections in all scenarios,
which adds complexity. This approach would be difficult to maintain in a larger application
with more routes and database operations.
