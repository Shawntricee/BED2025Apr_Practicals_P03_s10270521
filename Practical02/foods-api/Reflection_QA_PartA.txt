Reflection:
I really enjoyed learning about REST APIs in this lab. Before this,
I was confused about how APIs actually work, but now I understand that
it's just about using HTTP methods to interact with data.
Working with Express made it clearer how servers handle different types of requests.
I struggled a bit with understanding the difference between query parameters
and route parameters at first, but the food filtering example helped it click for me.

Q&A:
1. Why use POST for creating resources and PUT for updating?
POST is used for creating new stuff because it's meant for sending data that
will make something new on the server. You can send the same POST request
multiple times and it will create multiple copies. PUT is better for updates
because it replaces existing data completely and sending the same PUT request
multiple times won't keep creating new copies, it just updates the same resource
to the same state each time.

2. What status code should be returned when attempting to update a non-existent resource?
A 404 status code should be returned when trying to update something that doesn't exist.
This makes sense because the server is basically saying "I can't find what you're trying to update."
We did this in our code when we checked if the food with a specific ID exists before updating it.
